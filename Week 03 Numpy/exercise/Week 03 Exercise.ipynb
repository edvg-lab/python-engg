    "In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "$-x - 4y + 5z =  1$\n",

    "Create a Python program that will solve a system of `n` linear equations. By using Numpy, solving systems of equations becomes even easier to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Specification\n",
    "1. Ask the user to input the desired number of linear equations (this also equates to the matrix dimension)\n",
    "\n",
    "```Input dimension: 3 ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ask the user to input `nxn` numbers separated by comma. This will be the A matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Enter matrix A: 5, 3, 9, -2, 3, -1, -1, -4, 5 ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ask the user to input `n` numbers separated by comma. This will be the B matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Enter matrix B: -1, -2, 1```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Specification\n",
    "1. Print out the solution to the system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```The solution is:  0.326, -0.492, -0.128```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "1. Parse inputs `2` and `3`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inverse matrix A \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform dot multiplication on $A^{-1}$ and $B$ to solve for the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To practice your skills in Numpy, do not use the `np.linalg.solve` method. We will be using it however to verify if your solution is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "# !! Important !!\n",
    "1. Store the coefficient matrix in a Python variable `A` (case sensitive)\n",
    "2. Store the ordinates or “dependent variables” vector in a Python variable `B` (case sensitive)\n",
    "3. Store the solution vector in a Python variable `X` (case sensitive)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",
    "1. You can use a string's `split(delimeter)` function to split the input\n",
    "2. Numpy's `reshape()` function is great for converting a numpy array into a numpy matrix\n",
    "3. Use the last cell on the notebook to test out if your solution is correct."
